## Starting the program

After running the program, you are greeted with a welcome page, which then sends you to a login panel for a manager or a customer. You can log into old accounts, or sign up with a new username

        NOTE: To create a manager account, you need a main manager pass which is 123456 
        by default, and can be changed later on, but only by the main manager.
        The main manager is the first person who creates a manager account.

## Author Info

I'm Mohammad Asadpour, a computer engineering student at the Babol Noshirvani University of Technology (BNUT or NIT). I made this program as the final Project of my Basic Programming course. Even though I am a beginner in the Coding World, it has been an interesting ride so far, despite the hardships that came with it. But, in the end, as we all know:
        
        All beginnings are hard.
        To begin is easy; To persist is art.
